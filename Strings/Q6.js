// Check if a given string is a isomorphic

// For two strings to be isomorphic, all occurrences of a character in string A can be replaced with another character
// to get string B. The order of the characters must be preserved. There must be one-to-one mapping for ever char of
// string A to every char of string B.

// `paper` and `title` would return true.
// `egg` and `sad` would return false.
// `dgg` and `add` would return true.
