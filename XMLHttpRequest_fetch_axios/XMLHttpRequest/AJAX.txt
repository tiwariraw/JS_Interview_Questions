// AJAX stands for asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

// AJAX is not a technology itself, but rather an approach to using a
// number of existing technologies together, including HTML, CSS, JS, DOM, XML,
// and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object

// AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

// AJAX helps in fetching data asynchronously without interfering with the existing page

// No page reload/ refresh

// Despite having the word “XML” in its name, it can operate on any data, not only in XML format.
// Modern websites uses JSON instead of XML for data transfer.

// AJAX uses an XMLHttpRequest object to get(and send) data from the seerver.
// Data can be transferred in any format or protocol (not always https neccessarily)
